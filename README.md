# JHotDraw Refactored

This is a personal fork of the original [JHotDraw](http://www.jhotdraw.org/). It is focused on applying **Clean Code**, **SOLID principles**, and **modern Java best practices** to a legacy codebase.

The version utilized is the version `7.0.6` and it was downloaded from SourceForge
